# cpp-serializer

This is the cpp-serializer project. The main aim of this project is to add
modern serialization capability to C++. The first phase is to create a YAML
parser that can automatically load data to C++ structures while checking for
potential errors. Additionally, we would like to be able to report any
unrecognized data in the YAML file as an error with the exact location of the
error.
